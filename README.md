## üé® Recreate a $600,000 Damien Hirst Spot Painting with Code
Ever thought you could recreate a masterpiece worth $600,000 with just a few lines of code? Well, now you can! This Python program recreates Damien Hirst's iconic spot painting using nothing but the turtle module, a list of colors, and a little bit of coding magic.

## üñåÔ∏è How It Works
This project extracts the color palette from one of Damien Hirst's famous spot paintings and then uses turtle graphics to place those colors on a canvas in a grid pattern, much like the original artwork. Who knew art could be this easy (and cheap)?

## üì¶ Installation
Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed:

```bash

pip install colorgram.py
```
Also, ensure you have Python's turtle module ready to go.

## üíª Usage
Start by extracting colors from the spot painting image using colorgram:

```python

import colorgram

colors = colorgram.extract('damien-hirst-severed-spots.jpg', 88)

rgb_colors = []

for c in colors:
    r = c.rgb.r
    g = c.rgb.g
    b = c.rgb.b
    new_color = (r, g, b)
    rgb_colors.append(new_color)

print(rgb_colors)  # Uncomment to see the extracted colors
```
Once you have your color palette, use the following code to generate the spot painting:

```python

import turtle as t
import random

# Use this color list based on the extracted colors
color_list = [(250, 228, 17), (199, 12, 35), (213, 13, 9), (232, 228, 5), (198, 68, 20),
              (32, 90, 188), (43, 212, 72), (234, 149, 41), (33, 30, 153), (240, 246, 251),
              (16, 22, 55), (66, 9, 49), (244, 39, 148), (65, 202, 229), (14, 205, 222),
              (63, 21, 10), (224, 19, 111), (230, 164, 8), (15, 154, 22), (245, 59, 16),
              (98, 75, 9), (248, 11, 9), (223, 140, 203), (68, 240, 161), (10, 97, 62),
              (5, 38, 33), (68, 219, 155), (238, 157, 213), (85, 76, 209), (85, 225, 235),
              (251, 8, 16), (241, 167, 157), (177, 180, 224), (31, 244, 165), (7, 81, 113),
              (15, 52, 248)]

t.colormode(255)
tim = t.Turtle()
tim.penup()
tim.setx(-150)
tim.sety(150)

for _ in range(10):
    for _ in range(10):
        tim.pencolor(random.choice(color_list))
        tim.dot(20)
        tim.penup()
        tim.fd(50)
        tim.pendown()
    tim.penup()
    tim.setx(-150)
    tim.sety(tim.ycor() - 50)

t.mainloop()
```
## üñºÔ∏è Output
After running the code, you'll see a grid of colorful dots that look remarkably like a Damien Hirst spot painting. Congratulations! You've just created your very own $600,000 artwork.

## ü§î Why?
Because who wouldn‚Äôt want to say they've recreated a Damien Hirst painting in their free time? Plus, it‚Äôs a fun way to practice Python coding with turtle graphics.
